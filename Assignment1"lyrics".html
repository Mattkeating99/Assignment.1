                        <p>
                        Slow down, you crazy child
                        You're so ambitious for a juvenile
                        But then if you're so smart
                        Tell me why are you still so afraid? Mm
                        Where's the fire, what's the hurry about?
                        You'd better cool it off before you burn it out
                        You've got so much to do
                        And only so many hours in a day, hey  
                        </p>  
                <h4>[Chorus]</h4>
                    
                        <p>
                        But you know that when the truth is told
                        That you can get what you want or you can just get old
                        You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through, ooh
                        When will you realize Vienna waits for you?
                        </p>
                <h4>[Verse 2]</h4>
                         <p>
                            Slow down, you're doin' fine
                            You can't be everything you wanna be before your time
                            Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight, tonight
                            Too bad, but it's the life you lead
                            You're so ahead of yourself, that you forgot what you need
                            Though you can see when you're wrong
                            You know you can't always see when you're right
                            You're right        
                        </p>
                <h4>[Chorus]</h4>
                        <p> 
                                You've got your passion, you've got your pride
                                But don't you know that only fools are satisfied?
                                Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true, ooh
                                When will you realize Vienna waits for you?
                        
                                Slow down, you crazy child
                                And take the phone off the hook and disappear for a while
                                It's all right, you can afford to lose a day or two, ooh
                                When will you realize Vienna waits for you?
                        </p>
                <h4>[Outro]</h4> <!--outro-->
                        <p>
                                And you know that when the truth is told
                                That you can get what you want or you could just get old
                                You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through, ooh
                                Why don't you realize Vienna waits for you?
                                When will you realize Vienna waits for you?
                        </p>
